# Project Roadmap

This file tracks pending work items for coordination across agents and sessions.

## Status Legend
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[?]` - Blocked / Needs clarification

---

## Active Tasks

### Recipe Detail Page
- [ ] Add UI to create/add instructions for recipes that don't have any (recipes created before instructions feature was implemented have no way to add them)


## Notes

- Agents should not mark tasks as complete - human review required
- Update this file when starting/finishing work to avoid conflicts
- Completed tasks are removed during commits to prevent unbounded file growth
